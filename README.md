## Abstract
Tracking your intake is the first step to having a healthy physique. Taking 
this one step can enable someone to see harmful trends and make wiser decisions. 
We are developing a database management system that allows the user to 
do the same and tracks and stores the daily food intake of a person. Using an 
API, we will generate automated food nutrition analysis and reports containing 
charts for the user to visualize his food consumption better.
