## Abstract
Tracking your intake is the first step to having a healthy physique. Taking 
this one step can enable someone to see harmful trends and make wiser decisions. 
We are developing a database management system that allows the user to 
do the same and tracks and stores the daily food intake of a person. Using an 
API, we will generate automated food nutrition analysis and reports containing 
charts for the user to visualize his food consumption better.

## Project Overview
• Databases are a fundamental part of modern society. Daily tasks, such as banking transactions, booking hotels or flights, often involve interactions with databases. <br>
• The examples above illustrate classic database applications, where most data is textual or numeric and is stored and accessed. Our project will focus on this type of computer application. <br>
• Databases can be utilized in various forms, including object-oriented databases, relational databases, and file-handling mechanisms <br>
• This project provides insight into the Nutrition Management System's reservation management process. It demonstrates the entire process, offering options to add, modify, delete, and search nutrition management information. <br>

## Implementation

• **Development of Front-End**: We designed the website using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Both static and dynamic pages were created for users and the admin. <br>
• **Development of Back-End**: We utilized the Django framework along with a MySQL database to perform CRUD operations, including insertion, deletion, updating, and scanning of data. <br>
• **Integrating Front-end with Back-end**: We set up proper paths and displayed the appropriate data on the front-end using POST/GET requests. Additionally, we incorporated data visualization tools. <br>
• **Deployment of the Website**: Finally, we deployed our website onto a local host, making it available for users. <br>
